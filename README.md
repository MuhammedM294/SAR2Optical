SAR2Optical
==============================

This repository hosts a collection of experiments to test the effectiveness of transcoding Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery to optical ones. The focus of these experiments is on solving the challenge of waterbody extraction in arid regions posed by the similarity of the intensity values of waterbodies and sand landcover in SAR images.


### Project 1: Toushka Lakes 

This project focuses on the Toushka Lakes region in southern Egypt. The primary goal is to develop an advanced deep learning model for transcoding Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery into optical imagery. The deep neural network will be trained using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery captured between June 2019 and January 2022.
