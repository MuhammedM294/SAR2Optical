SAR2Optical
==============================

This repository hosts a collection of experiments to test the effectiveness of transcoding Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery to optical ones. The focus of these experiments is on solving the challenge of waterbody extraction in arid regions posed by the similarity of the backscattering properties (intensity values) between waterbodies and sand landcover in SAR images.

 
### Experiment 1: Transcoding Sentinel-1 SAR Image VV Band to NIR Band of Sentinel-2

The first experiment focuses on transcoding Sentinel-1 (SAR) imagery from the VV (vertical-vertical) polarization band to the Near-Infrared (NIR) band of Sentinel-2 optical imagery. The goal is to explore the feasibility of utilizing NIR data, which is sensitive to water content, to enhance the discrimination between waterbodies and sand landcover in arid regions.
